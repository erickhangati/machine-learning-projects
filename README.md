# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning project portfolio!  
This repository contains a growing collection of **real-world ML projects** — ranging from foundational implementations (from scratch) to practical solutions using libraries like `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `TensorFlow`, and more.

> 🧠 Built to learn, grow, and demonstrate applied ML skills in diverse contexts — from simple regression models to more complex pipelines.
