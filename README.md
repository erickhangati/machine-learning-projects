# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Machine Learning project portfolio!  
This repository contains a growing collection of **real-world ML projects** — ranging from foundational implementations (from scratch) to practical solutions using libraries like `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `TensorFlow`, and more.

> 🧠 Built to learn, grow, and demonstrate applied ML skills in diverse contexts — from simple regression models to more complex pipelines.

## 📁 Projects

### 🏡 [Linear Regression – House Price Prediction (NumPy Only)](./linear-regression/)
- Predict Seattle house prices based on house size
- Built from scratch using NumPy (no ML libraries)
- Covers cost function, feature scaling, gradient descent, and model evaluation

<!-- Add more projects below as they’re completed -->
<!-- Example:
### 🧠 [Logistic Regression – Email Spam Classification](./spam-logistic/)
- Predict spam vs. non-spam from email features
- Uses scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn
